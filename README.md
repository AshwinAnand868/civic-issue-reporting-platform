# Citizen Issue Reporting Platform (Work in Progress)

## Overview

This project is a **citizen reporting and civic issue-tracking
platform**, currently under development. The goal is to let citizens
easily report problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, garbage
issues, and more --- and track how those issues are handled by
authorities.

Citizens sign up, log in, submit reports (text, photo, or voice), and
view updates through their dashboard. Admin users will be able to
review, prioritize, and update cases.

The platform is being designed with a strong focus on **usability,
transparency, and AI-powered assistance**.

## Vision

The app aims to make public issue reporting: - **Simple** --- report via

By combining traditional workflows with modern AI tools, the platform
strives to improve both **citizen experience** and **government response
efficiency**.
